 <h1>T20 World Cup 2022 Analysis Project to Find best 11</h1>

   <p>This project is dedicated to conducting a comprehensive analysis of player performances during the T20 World Cup 2022, with the primary objective of selecting the best 11 players from the tournament. Leveraging the power of Python's Pandas library for efficient data processing and manipulation, and Power BI for visually appealing and insightful representations, this project provides a thorough exploration of the tournament's statistical landscape.</p>
<h2>Skills Required</h2>
<p>Skills are as follows:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Python Basics</li>
 <li>Python's Pandas</li>
 <li>Microsoft Power Bi</li>
</ul>
   <h2>Project Structure</h2>

   <p>The project structure is organized as follows:</p>

   <ul>
        <li><strong>Data</strong>: This directory contains the datasets utilized for analysis. These datasets encompass a wide range of statistics, including batting, bowling and overall player performance metrics, collected from the T20 World Cup 2022 matches.</li>
        <li><strong>scripts</strong>: In this directory, you'll find Python scripts responsible for data processing, analysis, and the formulation of the final best 11 players. These scripts leverage the Pandas library extensively to clean, transform, and analyze the raw data, ultimately extracting valuable insights to guide player selection.</li>
        <li><strong>visualizations</strong>: Within this directory, Power BI files are housed, showcasing visually rich and interactive visualizations of the analysis results. These visualizations offer intuitive representations of player performances, facilitating easy interpretation and comparison.</li>
     </ul>
     <h3>Data Collection</h3>

   <p>The data for this analysis was collected from the ESPN website, a reputable source for sports-related information, using Bright Data's web scraping services. Bright Data enables seamless and ethical web scraping by providing a vast pool of residential IPs, ensuring that data is gathered in a manner that respects website terms of service and legal requirements.</p>

   <p>By leveraging Bright Data's platform, we were able to programmatically access and extract relevant statistics and match details from the ESPN website, including batting, bowling, and fielding performances of players participating in the T20 World Cup 2022 matches. This facilitated the creation of a comprehensive dataset for subsequent analysis.</p>
 <h3>Data Processing</h3>

   <p>The data collected from the ESPN website was processed using Python Pandas within a Jupyter Notebook environment. The data processing steps included:</p>

   <ol>
        <li><strong>Data Loading:</strong> The raw data obtained from the web scraping process was loaded into the Jupyter Notebook environment using Pandas' read_csv() functions.</li>
        
   <li><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> The dataset underwent cleaning operations to address any inconsistencies, missing values, or formatting issues. This involved techniques such as removing duplicate entries, handling null values, and standardizing data formats across columns.</li>
        
   <li><strong>Data Transformation:</strong> Once cleaned, the dataset was transformed to extract relevant features and derive new variables that could aid in the analysis. This included calculating player averages, strike rates, economy rates, and aggregating statistics across matches.</li>
        
   </ol>
 <h3>Data Visualization</h3>

   <p>The analysis results obtained from the processed dataset were visualized using Power BI, a robust business analytics tool that enables the creation of interactive and visually engaging reports and dashboards.</p>

   <p>The visualization process involved the following key steps:</p>

   <ol>
        <li><strong>Data Import:</strong> The cleaned and transformed dataset generated in the Python environment was imported into Power BI for visualization. Power BI provides seamless integration with various data sources, allowing for easy import and manipulation of data.</li>
        
  <li><strong>Report Creation:</strong> Utilizing Power BI's intuitive drag-and-drop interface, reports were created to showcase different aspects of the analysis results. These reports included interactive visuals such as charts, graphs, tables, and maps, enabling users to explore and understand the data from multiple perspectives.</li>
        
   <li><strong>Dashboard Development:</strong> To provide a consolidated view of the analysis findings, dashboards were developed within Power BI. Dashboards act as dynamic containers for multiple reports and visuals, allowing users to view key insights at a glance and navigate between different analyses seamlessly.</li>
        
   <li><strong>Interactivity:</strong> Power BI offers extensive interactivity features, allowing users to filter, drill down, and slice and dice the data dynamically. This interactivity enhances the user experience, enabling deeper exploration and understanding of the analysis results.</li>
        
  <li><strong>Final 11:<strong> Finally we find our best possible 11 based on the performance on the 2022 T20 WC.</li>
    </ol>
