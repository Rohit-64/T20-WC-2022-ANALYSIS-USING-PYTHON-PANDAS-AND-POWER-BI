 <h1>T20 World Cup 2022 Analysis Project</h1>

   <p>This project is dedicated to conducting a comprehensive analysis of player performances during the T20 World Cup 2022, with the primary objective of selecting the best 11 players from the tournament. Leveraging the power of Python's Pandas library for efficient data processing and manipulation, and Power BI for visually appealing and insightful representations, this project provides a thorough exploration of the tournament's statistical landscape.</p>

   <h2>Project Structure</h2>

   <p>The project structure is organized as follows:</p>

   <ul>
        <li><strong>data</strong>: This directory contains the datasets utilized for analysis. These datasets encompass a wide range of statistics, including batting, bowling and overall player performance metrics, collected from the T20 World Cup 2022 matches.</li>
        <li><strong>scripts</strong>: In this directory, you'll find Python scripts responsible for data processing, analysis, and the formulation of the final best 11 players. These scripts leverage the Pandas library extensively to clean, transform, and analyze the raw data, ultimately extracting valuable insights to guide player selection.</li>
        <li><strong>visualizations</strong>: Within this directory, Power BI files are housed, showcasing visually rich and interactive visualizations of the analysis results. These visualizations offer intuitive representations of player performances, facilitating easy interpretation and comparison.</li>
        <li><strong>README.md</strong>: The README file provides an in-depth overview of the project, outlining its objectives, methodology, project structure, and any additional information pertinent to understanding and utilizing the project.</li>
    </ul>
